The file Project\+Ci\+File\+Change\+Logic.\+py in this directory is only a symlink to the real file under\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{commonTools/framework/ProjectCiFileChangeLogic.py}
\end{DoxyCode}


That is because that file is under the base directory for the {\ttfamily Trilinos\+Framework\+Tests} Tri\+B\+I\+TS package. We want changes to the file {\ttfamily Project\+Ci\+File\+Change\+Logic.\+py} to trigger the enable of the Trilinos\+Framework\+Tests package so as to run the unit tests for that Python module. But the file {\ttfamily Project\+Ci\+File\+Change\+Logic.\+py} also needs to exist in this {\ttfamily cmake/} directory so that Tri\+B\+I\+TS tools will find it and use it automatically. Using a symbolic link satisfies both of these requirements.
