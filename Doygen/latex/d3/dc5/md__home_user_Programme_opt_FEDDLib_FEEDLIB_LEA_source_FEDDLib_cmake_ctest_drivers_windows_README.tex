The following list of software is required by the Windows build scripts. The build scripts assume this software will be installed in specific locations, so before installing it would be worthwhile to browse the scripts for these locations. Alternatively, you could download and install the software wherever you want -\/ just be sure to copy and update the build scripts with the correct locations.

{\bfseries{\href{https://cmake.org/download/}{\texttt{ C\+Make}}}} -\/ required to setup the build configuration. (Tested using version 3.\+8.\+1)

{\bfseries{\href{https://ninja-build.org/}{\texttt{ Ninja}}}} -\/ required to parallelize the build on Windows. (Tested using version 1.\+7.\+2)

{\bfseries{\href{https://www.visualstudio.com/}{\texttt{ Visual Studio 2015}}}} -\/ required to build packages.

{\bfseries{\href{https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb524831(v=vs.85).aspx}{\texttt{ Microsoft M\+PI}}}} -\/ required to create M\+PI builds of packages. (Tested using version 8.\+1.\+12438.\+1084)

{\bfseries{Perl}} -\/ required by some packages for testing. (Tested using \href{http://strawberryperl.com/}{\texttt{ Strawberry Perl}} version 5.\+24.\+1.\+1)

{\bfseries{\href{https://git-scm.com/}{\texttt{ Git}}}} -\/ required for the scripts to update source code.

{\bfseries{C\+L\+A\+P\+A\+CK}} -\/ required T\+PL dependency for some packages (Tested using version 3.\+2.\+1). Note that if a pre-\/built version is not available, you must \href{http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/clapack/}{\texttt{ build it from source code}}.

\doxysection*{Script Usage}

There are two scripts intended for the typical user -\/ {\itshape task\+\_\+driver\+\_\+windows.\+bat} and {\itshape create\+\_\+windows\+\_\+package.\+bat}. For details about additional scripts, please refer to the \href{\#Script-File-Summary}{\texttt{ Script File Summary}} section below.

\doxysubparagraph*{task\+\_\+driver\+\_\+windows.\+bat}

This script builds and tests Trilinos packages for both Debug and Release configurations, following the Trilinos package-\/by-\/package testing paradigm. The packages are built as static libraries, and the results are submitted to \href{https://testing-vm.sandia.gov/cdash}{\texttt{ C\+Dash}}. This script may be launched from the command-\/line as is, without any additional arguments.

\doxysubparagraph*{create\+\_\+windows\+\_\+package.\+bat}

This script creates a Z\+IP package of static libraries and header files from the set of Trilinos packages specified in the script. The expected syntax to use the script is\+:

{\ttfamily create\+\_\+windows\+\_\+package.\+bat $<$Build Type$>$ $<$Base Directory$>$}

where {\ttfamily $<$Build Type$>$} specifies the build configuration (Release or Debug) and {\ttfamily $<$Base Directory$>$} specifies a root working directory where the script will clone/update the Trilinos repository as a sub-\/directory, create a build sub-\/directory to do the actual build, and place resulting output files and Z\+IP package. For example,


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{create\_windows\_package.bat Debug C:\(\backslash\)path\(\backslash\)to\(\backslash\)DebugPackageDir}
\end{DoxyCode}


would create a Debug build of static libraries, and at the end of the script the base directory would have the following contents\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{C:\(\backslash\)path\(\backslash\)to\(\backslash\)DebugPackageDir}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/ build                     (Build directory)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/ Trilinos                  (Source code directory)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/ update\_output.txt         (Output from the Git update step)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/ configure\_output.txt      (Output from the Configure step)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/ build\_output.txt          (Output from the build step)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/ package\_output.txt        (Output from the package step)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/ trilinos-\/setup-\/12.3.zip   (Resulting ZIP package)}
\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysection*{Script File Summary}

\doxysubparagraph*{Trilinos\+C\+Test\+Driver\+Core.\+windows.\+msvc.\+cmake}

C\+Make script that sets the options common to both the Debug and Release configurations of a Trilinos build on Windows using Visual Studio, including the specific Trilinos packages to be built. This script follows the Trilinos package-\/by-\/package testing paradigm. This script assumes specific build tools exist (e.\+g., Ninja, M\+S\+V\+C14, M\+PI, etc.) and assumes where they will be located on Windows.

\doxysubparagraph*{create\+\_\+windows\+\_\+package.\+bat}

Windows batch script that creates a Z\+IP package of static libraries and header files. It updates or clones the latest version of Trilinos as necessary, sets up a build environment for M\+S\+V\+C14, configures and runs C\+Make, then builds the specified Trilinos packages using Ninja and M\+S\+VC. After the build is complete, it creates the Z\+IP package using C\+Pack. The output for each step of the process is recorded in individual files (e.\+g., configure\+\_\+output.\+txt, build\+\_\+output.\+txt, etc.) within the specified working directory.

\doxysubparagraph*{ctest\+\_\+windows\+\_\+mpi\+\_\+debug.\+cmake}

C\+Make file that sets the build configuration for a Debug build before calling {\itshape Trilinos\+C\+Test\+Driver\+Core.\+windows.\+msvc.\+cmake}.

\doxysubparagraph*{ctest\+\_\+windows\+\_\+mpi\+\_\+release.\+cmake}

C\+Make file that sets the build configuration for a Release build before calling {\itshape Trilinos\+C\+Test\+Driver\+Core.\+windows.\+msvc.\+cmake}

\doxysubparagraph*{task\+\_\+driver\+\_\+windows.\+bat}

Windows batch script that sets important environment variables before running {\itshape ctest\+\_\+windows\+\_\+mpi\+\_\+debug.\+cmake} and {\itshape ctest\+\_\+windows\+\_\+mpi\+\_\+release.\+cmake} using C\+Test.

\doxysection*{Notes and Issues}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The scripts assume they are starting from a clean environment. All necessary environment variables are set by the scripts.
\item When installing Perl on Windows, it likes to insert itself into the system or user P\+A\+TH environment variable. This can have unintended consequences when running C\+Make, the most notable of which is that C\+Make will (wrongly) assume certain executables in Perl are part of the compiler. As a result, C\+Make won\textquotesingle{}t find the correct M\+S\+VC compiler and linker, and the configure step will fail. If possible, try to keep Perl out of the P\+A\+TH when using these scripts, or else modify the P\+A\+TH before running the scripts to remove Perl.
\item As noted in Trilinos Pull Request \href{https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/pull/1197}{\texttt{ \#1197}}, the /bigobj compiler flag is necessary for debug builds, and is included in the build scripts.
\item At the time of writing, the Zoltan tests fail on Windows as noted in Trilinos Issue \href{https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/issues/1440}{\texttt{ \#1440}}.
\item The packages are currently built as static libraries. If shared libraries are desired, an effort would need to be made to resolve certain build issues. Also, care would need to be taken to ensure P\+A\+T\+Hs are setup correctly for the libraries to find each other during the build and testing.
